        <h2>Biography of Atal Bihari Vajpayee</h2>
        <h5 class="early">Early Life and Education</h5>
        <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee was born on December 25, 1924, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. He hailed from a middle-class Brahmin family. From a young age, Vajpayee displayed exceptional oratory skills and a keen interest in politics. He completed his schooling from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Gwalior, and later pursued his higher education at Victoria College (now Laxmi Bai College) in Gwalior and DAV College in Kanpur.</p>

        <h5>Involvement in Politics</h5>
        <p>Vajpayee's political journey began during his college days when he became associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization. He was deeply influenced by the ideologies of the RSS and its leaders, such as Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Deendayal Upadhyaya.
        In 1951, Vajpayee co-founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the political arm of the RSS, and soon emerged as one of its prominent leaders. He was elected as a Member of Parliament to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1957 from Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh. Vajpayee's eloquence and moderate approach helped him gain respect and popularity, both within his party and among political opponents</p>

        <h5>Rise to Prominence</h5>
        <p>Over the years, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's stature within the Jana Sangh grew steadily. He was known for his ability to forge alliances and maintain strong relationships across party lines.

        <h5>Founding the BJP and Prime Ministerial Tenure</h5>
        <p>In 1980, after the Janata Party's coalition collapsed, Vajpayee re-established the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its own separate political entity. Under his leadership, the BJP steadily gained prominence and emerged as a major force in Indian politics.
        In 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was elected as the Prime Minister of India for the first time, but his government lasted only for 13 days. However, he did not give up, and in 1998, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a significant victory in the general elections, and Vajpayee once again became the Prime Minister.
        During his second term as Prime Minister from 1998 to 1999, Vajpayee's government conducted a series of nuclear tests in Pokhran, establishing India as a nuclear power. His government also focused on economic reforms, infrastructure development, and improving India's international relations.</p>

He displayed statesmanship by not crossing the Line of Control during the conflict, and once the conflict was resolved, he extended a hand of friendship towards Pakistan, advocating for peace and dialogue.</p>

His visionary project, the Golden Quadrilateral, aimed at connecting major cities through a network of highways, was initiated during this time.</p>
